The inverted pyramid structure involves starting any content with the most crucial information in the lead paragraph, followed by additional details in descending order of importance in subsequent paragraphs. This concept translates well when you are writing website content, where busy readers seek specific information quickly. Web copy should follow the inverted pyramid structure, by placing the most important information first, followed by the supporting information in order of importance, with the least important at the bottom. Apply this style to each page and paragraph."
